# Week Two Assignment: List and Tuple Operations

## Description

This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates various operations on lists and tuples. The assignment tasks include:
- **List Operations:** Creating an empty list (`my_list`), appending elements, inserting a value, extending the list with another list, removing the last element, sorting the list, and finding the index of a specific value.
- **Tuple Operations:** Creating a tuple, accessing elements, and using slicing to demonstrate the immutability of tuples.

The code is well-commented and follows Python best practices, showcasing your understanding of these core concepts.

## Features

- **List Operations:**
  - Create an empty list.
  - Append the values: `10`, `20`, `30`, and `40`.
  - Insert the value `15` at the second position.
  - Extend the list with `[50, 60, 70]`.
  - Remove the last element from the list.
  - Sort the list in ascending order.
  - Find and print the index of the value `30`.

- **Tuple Operations:**
  - Create a tuple with five favorite fruits.
  - Access tuple elements using indexing.
  - Use slicing to retrieve a subset of the tuple.
  - Illustrate that tuples are immutable.
